IAPWS must be compiled with gcc. For windows, see MSYS2 for installing gcc toolchain. 

mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=release ..
cmake --build .
cmake --install --prefix=/path/to/location

/path/to/location must contain 3 folders: bin, include, lib

On Unix systems the prefix is usually /usr/local.

On windows, you need to create the folder in the location of your choice. The installation process will copy all msys dlls 
necessary for the program to execute properly.
